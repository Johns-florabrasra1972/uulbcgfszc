Dude, just walked out of Mountainhead, and my head's still spinning like a tilt-a-whirl on steroids. Theater was chaos—like, popcorn stuck to my pants, sticky floor, and someone's phone kept buzzing behind me. Argh! But oh man, that movie. It was like every twist and turn was a gut punch.

That scene where the mountain literally opens up like a massive celestial mouth—I don't even know how to describe it. It was like being swallowed by a cosmic spaghetti monster? And the colors, holy crap, like Lisa Frank went on a psychedelic hike and spilled her crayon box everywhere. Totally nuts, swear there was a moment I thought the film caught the smell of pine trees. Some sort of cinematic scratch-and-sniff miracle.

> The protagonist, she was like this fierce wildfire—don’t even know her name 'cause my brain was too busy trying to untangle the plot from the popcorn crumbs in my hair. Kinda reminded me of that time my cat got stuck in a curtain, but with more wisdom and way better dialogue. Oh, and the music! Brooding cello meets synthwave madness or something. My back was aching, but I barely noticed 'cause I was glued to the screen, practically inhaling the epicness.

Remember how you wanted to maybe download the movie? I'd say do it, watch the movie, in as much splendor as you can muster at home. Just beware—it’s like an asteroid smashing through your brain and heart in equal measure.

The final act—like, I’m still reeling—felt like juggling flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope made of emotions and existential dread. Edge of my seat doesn’t even cut it; it was more edge of my very being, man. The antagonist's reveal? More shocking than finding pineapple on a pizza—not gonna lie. Yet somehow, it worked. The entire theater was, like, a collective exhale by the end.

Alright, before I go rambling into oblivion about how much it scrambled my neurons, here's a thought. Sometimes I felt like a piece of astral driftwood, carried by the grand weirdness.

```
#include <iostream>
void baffledByEnding() {
   std::cout << Did anyone even understand that ending? << std::endl;
   // Insert emotional processing here
}
```
